# Financial management
  ## 📌 About the Project
In this project, I create a simple financial manager developed as part of a recruitment challenge I participated in. Here, I share my problem-solving approach and my initial Java skills, focusing on concepts such as class creation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

  ## 🧭 Features
The program simulates a personal financial management system where the user can:

- Navigate between accounts in different banks;
- View, edit, and conduct transactions;
- Track expenses and income by category and time period;

## 📂 Interactive Menu
The interaction is carried out via an interactive command-line menu, allowing the user to select an action and be redirected to specific menus with more options.

#### Main Menu:
- **Account Manager:** the user will be able to create a new account, delete an existing account and merge transactions between two existing accounts.
- **Transfer Manager:** the user will be able to see the summary of his chosen account, add a new transaction or edit an existing one, and transfer funds from one account to another.
- **General Dashboard:** the user will be able to see the summary of all his accounts, the summary of the expenses and income of the chosen month, and see the general balance of the last 6 months and see the expense by category (food, housing, etc.)

## 🛠️ Techs
* **Java:** object-oriented concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, along with practice in control structures and organization using multiple classes.

## 📝 Final Considerations
Working on this project was a fantastic chance to sharpen my programming skills and get a feel for how a basic financial system works. While it doesn't include a database or a graphical interface, it's a solid starting point with lots of room for future upgrades.
