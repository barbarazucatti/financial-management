# Financial management
  ## Summary
In this project, I create a simple financial manager, an idea that came from the challenge of a selection process in which I participated.
Here I share my initial skills in Java and, mainly, my way of solving the proposed problems.

  ## Contet
The financial manager is a program that allows the user to browse their accounts in different banks, consulting, editing and carrying out transactions.

  ### Interactive Menu
The user's first contact with the program is an interactive menu that shows some options for actions. In response to the chosen action, the user will be taken to different menus with another set of actions available.
#### Menu Option:
- Account manager: the user will be able to create a new account, delete an existing account and merge transactions between two existing accounts.
- Transfer manager: the user will be able to see the summary of his chosen account, add a new transaction or edit an existing one, and transfer funds from one account to another.
- General panel: the user will be able to see the summary of all his accounts, the summary of the expenses and income of the chosen month, and see the general balance of the last 6 months and see the expense by category (food, housing, etc.)

  ## Techs
* Java: in this project i explored class creation and inheritance and polymorphism.
